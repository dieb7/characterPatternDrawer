This program was written on a Linux computer, instructions should be
similar for a mac but I have no way to try it.

To build the command line program run:
$ make build

This will build the commandline program called characterPatternDrawer.

To run it you just need to run the program passing the parameters shown:
./characterPatternDrawer tree|x <row amount>

For unit testing I used the cpputest framework version 3.8:
	https://cpputest.github.io/
You will need to download and build it.
This are the steps I followed to build cpputest:

$ cd <path to cpputest extraction>
$ autogen.sh
$ configure
$ make

To Run the tests you will need to create the CPPUTEST_HOME pointing to
the path where you extracted and build cpputest in the previous step.
And then to build and run the tests you just type make test from the to
of this project.

$ export CPPUTEST_HOME=<path to cpputest extraction>
$ make test
